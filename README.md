This repository contains the system's domain components, application services (uses cases),
and a web API interface used to interact with our workflow management system.

This project is based on C# and .NET Framework and can be compiled using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.

As other Empiria products, this backend runs over [Empiria Framework](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Core)
components and, as usual, needs [Empiria Central](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Central) and
some of the [Empiria Extensions](https://github.com/Ontica/Empiria.Extensions).
